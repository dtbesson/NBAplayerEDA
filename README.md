## Introduction
This is a quick project done at home to practise creating some different visualisations on univariate and multivariate datasets. There is also some basic data cleaning done at the start.

## The Data
The credit for this dataset goes to user Omri Goldstein on Kaggle. It can be found at this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgilermo/nba-players-stats-20142015 .

The data is quite clean, but it has some null values for some of the players.

## The Process
Please check the attached Jupyter notebook to see the details of the process!
